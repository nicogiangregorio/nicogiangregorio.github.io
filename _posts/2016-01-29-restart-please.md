A long time ago, I started blogging for fighting laziness: my old, rarely updated, blog is [here](https://nicogiangregorio.wordpress.com/). My intention is to publish code on github more frequently and share some thought on this blog. Three streams are in my mind in this moment:

* Software engineering and architecture is my longtime passion and I can't imagine to not blogging about it
* Data science, I am a wannabe data scientist, but I would like to share some results here
* Agile software delivery, recently adopted and loved it.

See you soon!
